# TIME-SERIES-BASED-PREDICTION-IN-REAL-TIME-PRODUCTION-ENVIROMENT-

This projectâ€™s main goal is to resolve this problem by developing the web Application tool which display the amount of product produced by the each and every machine in the plant for next upcoming days. This helps the production team supervisor in the organization to schedule the work for the workers in the machines for the further days and they know the capacity of machines. For product become failure by the machine I have collected the machine sensor value and built the model and predict whether the product come out by the machine is failure or not. It helps for the machine operators to check the sensor values and may reduce the rejection in the daily production. For maintenance team to make the work easier the dashboard has been created to view which problem is mostly affected the machines and how much product are become failure by those reasons. It helps for the maintenance crew to identify the problem easier and repair the machines faster and given to the production team.
